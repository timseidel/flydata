This is the final exercise of the
beginners R-course at the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany.

The project uses data from the nycflights23 package:
Ismay C, Couch S, Wickham H (2024). nycflights23: Flights and Other Useful 
Metadata for NYC outbound flights in 2023. 
R package version 0.1.0, http://github.com/moderndive/nycflights23. 

FLYDATA is an imaginary company only used to increase immersion.

# FLYDATA
Your Co-Pilot in Data Driven Decisions. 

## Briefing

Hey,

Welcome to FLYDATA! I hope you're settling in well and finding your first few 
days with us both exciting and inspiring. As a new team member, I'm thrilled to
see you dive into the world of data-driven decisions alongside us. 
As we discussed last week, I've attached some files that will be instrumental 
for you to review and refine over the coming days.

While working with these files, you'll be navigating some R code that presents 
a few challenges and opportunities for development. These areas have been 
identified as needing improvement, and your fresh perspective will be invaluable
as we look to optimize our data workflows. This is a perfect opportunity for you
to gain hands-on experience with our coding style, aligning with our mission to
be "Your Co-Pilot in Data-Driven Decisions."

The ultimate goal is to enhance and complete a Markdown 
document that showcases Flydata's capabilities to potential clients. You'll 
begin by cloning the GitHub repository at https://github.com/timseidel/flydata/ 
into your RStudio instance. Within this repository, you'll find a "data" folder 
containing all the necessary datasets. There's also a "Import.R" script 
intended for data import and cleaning. However, similar to the Markdown document, 
the code in "01_import.R" is either missing or not functioning correctly. 
Your task is to develop this script alongside the Markdown document, 
performing data import, cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

To guide you through this journey, Tim will be your dedicated support. 
He'll conduct a comprehensive code review with you at the end of our session, 
ensuring you stay on track and have all the guidance you need. In the meantime, 
Tim is available to answer any questions or provide insights. His expertise 
and openness will be invaluable as you navigate through these tasks, 
ensuring you have the support necessary to excel.

Addressing these R code challenges will not only enhance our team's efficiency 
and output but also empower you by bridging theory with practical application. 
By exploring alternative coding solutions and best practices, you'll be 
strengthening your skill set while supporting our company's commitment to 
delivering high-quality, data-driven insights.

Thank you for your dedication to starting strong in your new role. 
Your hard work is already appreciated, and I'm excited to see your 
contributions as we at FLYDATA soar to new heights together.

Fly high,

Mary
