This is the final exercise of the
beginners R-course at the University of Münster, Germany.

The project uses data from the nycflights23 package:
Ismay C, Couch S, Wickham H (2024). nycflights23: Flights and Other Useful 
Metadata for NYC outbound flights in 2023. 
R package version 0.1.0, http://github.com/moderndive/nycflights23. 

FLYDATA is an imaginary company only used to increase immersion.

# FLYDATA
Your Co-Pilot in Data Driven Decisions. 

## Briefing

Hey,

Welcome to FLYDATA Münster! I hope you're settling in and 
enjoying your first few days here. As part of the team, 
you'll explore data-driven decisions with us. I've attached some files 
for you to refine over the coming days.

#### Tasks:

1. The ultimate goal is to enhance and complete a Markdown 
(analysis-and-visualization.Rmd)
document that showcases Flydata's capabilities to potential clients.

2. You'll begin by cloning the GitHub repository at 
https://github.com/timseidel/flydata/ 
into your RStudio instance.

3. Within this repository, you'll find a "data" folder
containing all the necessary datasets. There's also a "import.R" script 
intended for data import and cleaning. However, similar to the 
Markdown document, the code in "import.R" is either missing or 
not functioning correctly. 

Once again: Your task is to develop this script alongside the Markdown document, 
performing data import, cleaning, transformation, and analysis!

Tim is your support. He'll review your code at the end of the session, 
answering questions and providing insights as needed.


Thank you for your dedication. 
I'm excited to see your contributions as we at FLYDATA soar together.

Fly high,

Mary
Head of Empirical Analysis
